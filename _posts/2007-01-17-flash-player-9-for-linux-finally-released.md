Today the final version of the <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2007/01/flash_player_9_for_linux_x86.html" title="Flash Player 9 for Linux has been released!" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/blogs_adobe_com_penguinswf');">Flash Player 9 for Linux</a> has been released - <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer/" title="Follow this link to download the Flash Player 9 for Linux" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/www_adobe_com_getflash');">go get it</a>!

I have actually enjoyed two beta releases prior to this final release and I have to say there were stable enough for me - despite the odd Firefox crash while watching several movies in a row and occasional video/audio synchronization issue that I didn't like. I'm already seeing the effects of audio/video synchronization issues that have been resolved in the final version and I really hope it proves to be more stable as well...

I find it especially pleasing that, probably for the first time in history, version number of Flash Player for Linux is <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/about/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/macromedia_com_flash_about');">higher</a> than version number of Flash Player for any other platform - it used to be the other way round...

So, users of  Linux for Mac don`t have Flash and SUN Java. And I think will never have because IBM not producing anymore that processor.<br />
	<br />
	Of course, here is an open source flash player (gnash) but is a long way until will provide decent platform for Linux&Mac users .<br />

	Nice mod (ShareThis), I had to disable Noscript in FF to be able to see it, but I like it.</p></div>

Just recently I read an article about the state of Flash on the web scene - in short saying how it became very widespread and <em>it is proprietary</em> technology, which is... well, bad to say the least...<br /> Not to mention that Adobe isn&#39;t doing a good job making it available to everyone. I&#39;ll see if I can find it...<br />
	<br />
	About the ShareThis and having to disable Noscript to use it, I&#39;ll look into what can be done to avoid that for users who can&#39;t use or choose to disable JavaScript. I believe it should fall back to a simple link to landing page with the same options you&#39;d get if you had JavaScript enabled.<br />

	P.S. hehe, I replied yesterday and then forgot I have to approve myself too...</p></div>
