If you still haven't, then learn this game now! It's fun and it allows you to exercise your brain!

Ever since I watched <a href="http://www.abeautifulmind.com/" title="A Beautiful Mind movie website">A Beautiful Mind</a>, I've been <em>"planning"</em> to learn this game, called simply <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(board_game)" title="Go">Go</a></em>, that Nash and his buddies played in the movie (which I also recommend; it's a <em>great</em> movie about a great man!).

I'll never forget this scene, when he's challenged to play the game and he says this unforgettable line: "I'm terrified, mortified, petrified, stupefied... by you."

So I've had to write a few lines on the game theory tonight, which of course got me to think about that movie and in no time I wandered off to YouTube to watch some scenes. <br />
The end results was me learning how to play Go game from this <a href="http://playgo.to/interactive/" title="Go game interactive tutorial">Go game interactive tutorial</a>. <br />Now I have to write a few lines about game theory tomorrow morning...<br />
But a day wasn't lost! As I learned, I played a bit of Go and I exercised my brain, which you can do too!

There's a <a href="http://www.britgo.org/gopcres/gopcres1.html" title="A list of software to play Go">list of software to play Go</a> (for all kinds of platforms). Enjoy!
