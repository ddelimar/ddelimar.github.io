<p class="quote">“Try not. Do, or do not, there is no try.”</p>
<p class="quoteauthor">~ Yoda in episode V of the Star Wars series</p>

No I'm not a huge fan of the Star Wars. I liked what I've watched of the series, but I'm not that huge of a fan - okay, I'm more of a Star Trek fan if really you need to know.

But I digress once again. I just found this quote and thought how good it is and how I should memorize it.

Actually, I'm gonna try to explain it a bit further: Michael Licenblat mentioned it in his article where he talks about the assumptions we make of ourselves and how these same assumptions influence "what we try, achieve and believe" about ourselves.

And talking about our assumption of our own ability, he goes to explain that ability itself is irrelevant and only our assumptions about our ability will decide the degree of ability we exert.

In a sense, if we believe we can do it, we're more likely to do it than if we didn't believe it. That's <em>so true</em>. And now we're back to what Henry Ford once said, and what I mentioned <a href="http://domdelimar.com/success-quotes/pessimism-never-won-any-battle/" title="last time">last time</a>: 
<p class="quote">“Whether you believe you can do it or not, you are right.”</p>

There's so much to this principle but I'll cover it in more detail at another occasion. For now I'll let you read Michael  Licenblat's <a href="http://www.bouncebackfast.com/articles/stress_management_article_PursuitofHappiness.html" title="article">article</a>.

I often catch myself doing that mistake, only trying something until the resistance gets too big.

I'll try (pun intended) to <em>do</em> more than <em>just try</em> from now on.
