Mark Joyner, author of over a dozen books translated in almost as many languages is releasing a new one:

<span style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://uncover.simpleology.com/book/" rel="external" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/uncover_simpleology_com_book');"><img src="../../../../domdelimar.com/images/simpleologythebook.html" style="padding:1px;border:none;" alt="Simpleology: The Simple Science of Getting What You Want" /></a><br />
<b><em><a href="http://uncover.simpleology.com/book/" rel="external" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/uncover_simpleology_com_book');">Simpleology: The Simple Science of Getting What You Want</a></em></b></span>

But this is more than a book. Simpleology book complements itself with the already famous <a href="http://uncover.simpleology.com/" title="Simpleology 101 program" rel="external" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/uncover_simpleology_com');">Simpleology 101 program</a> which is a 18 day course <em>for life</em>.

<a href="http://uncover.simpleology.com/" title="Simpleology 101" rel="external" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/uncover_simpleology_com');"><img src="http://www.simpleology.com/sgx/uncover" style="float:right;padding:1px;border:none;" alt="Simpleology 101: The Simple Science of Getting What You Want" /></a>Simpleology 101 gets you on track towards your goals through 18 short, easy-to-understand multimedia lessons that require only 15 minutes a day of your time. It's fun and intuitive. You learn a lot of powerful stuff that leave you wondering how simple this is and how come more people are not fully aware of it...

And just as the book itself says: <br />
"<em>simpleÂ·ology: The Simple Science of Getting What You<br />
Want</em> is merely the companion to a multimedia learning<br />
experience and some life-changing software--all of<br />
which you can access for free."

I couldn't recommend you <a href="http://uncover.simpleology.com/" title="Simpleology 101" rel="external" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/uncover_simpleology_com');">Simpleology 101</a> more. Besides, it's free so you've got nothing to loose unless you're one of those freebie-hunters who would stuff their computer will hundreds of freebies only to let them sit there for ages, even forgetting about some. <br />Even if you have acted like this on occasion or two (I will admit I have), don't let this "freebie" slip through your hands just because it's given at no cost. All it really demands from you is 15 minutes of each day to devote them to YOURSELF. And if you can't do that, well, I don't know what to say to you. Simpleology 101 has changed my life in a number of ways about which you will be able to read on this site soon. But there's no need for you to wait for anything. Go <a href="http://uncover.simpleology.com/" title="Simpleology 101" rel="external" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/uncover_simpleology_com');">there</a> and join now!

But if you're really afraid you might let this go unused simply because it's free, there's good news for you. This <a href="http://uncover.simpleology.com/book/" rel="external" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/uncover_simpleology_com_book');">book</a> Mike has published does cost money, it's tangible and might just be exactly what you need.<br />
