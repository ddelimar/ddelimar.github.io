Psychology is powerful stuff... Knowing psychology is a powerful weapon of influence.

So you probably wonder why somebody would write something<em> so controversial</em> it was later pulled off Amazon (after becoming a bestseller) because, supposedly, the information former  US army intelligence agent put in it was <em>so powerful</em>, it could easily be used to manipulate innocent people.

There were rumors about unfinished chapter and these were apparently true!

<a href="http://www.mindcontrolmarketing.com/p/mcm/uncover/">And now, years later, it's being released again!</a>

WARNING: <br />I've been told not to watch the above 2 minute video if I'm 
<br />
overly-sensitive or if I have a cardio-vascular condition.

I'll tell you why it's being released again: because people need to be informed about these ideas so they may protect themselves.

I trust your judgment and appreciate the link, though.  Perhaps I&#39;ll also pick up a copy of Sun Tzu&#39;s Art of War.  <br />
    <br />
    By the way...I&#39;m learning php through sNews as well!  =)  I&#39;ll stop back in a comment when I can.</p></div>

    <br />
    I like some of Mark Joyner&#39;s products (like <a href="http://domdelimar.com/self-improvement/simpleology-heres-some-dynamite-for-your-brain/">Simpleology</a>) but didn&#39;t get the first edition of MCM, and I&#39;ll see if I&#39;ll get this one right now based on the pricing... There&#39;s no point in me cashing out big bucks on something like this at this moment, but if it&#39;s at a reasonable price... I like reading about psychology so I&#39;m sure some concepts would be familiar to me.<br />
    <br />
    So don&#39;t buy it just because it&#39;s <em>*hot*</em> at the moment, but only if you think you can benefit from it now. Like, do you have a running business you can apply this principles to?<br />
    <br />
    Try reading the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Freview%2Fproduct%2F0971932506%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8%26showViewpoints%3D1&amp;tag=businesslette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">reviews on Amazon</a><img src="../../../../www.assoc-amazon.com/e/irc4e8.gif?t=businesslette-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> to help you decide.<br />
    <br />
    And about learning PHP - sNews is the way to do it - just dig in... and then try to dig yourself out ;P</p></div>

    But I just thought you should know.</p></div>
