Without a doubt, I made my only notable mod so far, <a href="http://domdelimar.com/snews/additional-article-position-options-mod-snews/">Additional Article Position Options for sNews 1.5</a> out of a necessity.

It shows you just how much I need this mod that even though a new version of sNews (1.6) has been out since May 16, 2007 it took me until two weeks ago to migrate from version 1.5.31 to sNews 1.6.0 - all because I had to have my mod even in the new version - and didn't have time to deal with porting it to the new version of sNews.

As I was called by <a href="http://snewscms.com/forum/index.php?topic=1762.msg33046#msg33046" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/solucija_com_forum_ravingfans');">raving fans from sNews community</a> that I make this mod functional for sNews 1.6, I set out to do it. Thanks to that, this website is now on the latest sNews version and other sNews users can now follow the <a href="http://snewscms.com/forum/index.php?topic=5407" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/solucija_com_forum_aapo-mod-v16');">instructions on how to apply the Additional Article Position Options mod</a> to their sNews 1.6 websites.

You have the option of simply taking an already modified clean snews.php file from here:

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc;padding:0 10px;font-size:0.8em;background:#F5F5F5;margin:0 10px;">
    <a href="/goodies/snews.php_add_article_position_mod_v16.tar.html" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/download/snews.php_add_article_position_mod.tar.html');">snews.php_add_article_position_mod_v16.tar.bz2</a> - 22,5KB

    <a href="/goodies/snews.php_add_article_position_mod_v16.html" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/download/snews.php_add_article_position_mod.html');">snews.php_add_article_position_mod_v16.zip</a> - 25,3KB

    (both files have identical content)
</div>

I apologize for the wait to everybody using this mod and it would be great to know how many sNews users depend on me to continue developing this mod or at least would like me to do that.

Yes, you can tell me by commenting on this article.

It is an excellent mod and it is a good one to keep up to date. The extra positions are quite useful for certain installations. I have been using it in a few sites since your first version for 1.5 and I had added an extra-2 and an extra-3 to 1.6 in mid-June when another sNews member was looking for this. I did it because I also wanted to have them, and I had posted a link to a zip file containing the snews.php (with no other mods) but I cannot find it now.<br />
    <br />
    Anyway... as you&#39;ll see in a new Forum under sNews 1.6, I made use of them to manage block-files in a 3-column template today, and they work great in this particular application. So, yes, this is an important mod to keep up to date.</p></div>

    <br />
    Well, I&#39;ll do my best to keep it up to date from now on.<br />
    <br />
    I haven&#39;t seen it before but now I actually stumbled upon the link to a zip file you&#39;re mentioning: <a href="http://www.solucija.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=5063">[MOD] 2 more Extra Functions for sNews 1.6.0</a>. Nice job!<br />
    <br />
    I&#39;ve also briefly checked out your latest application  and from what I see it seems very interesting and something I might use myself. I&#39;ll have to make some time to explore it even further though... <br />
    *tight on schedule, gotta run now!*</p></div>

    <div class="comment"><p class="date"><p>Jill on <a id="Comment4" name="Comment4" title="Comment 4"></a>July 27, 2007:</p><p>Hey Dom, your site is awesome!!! I&#39;ve learned so much about Linux and I just love the look of site!!!<br />
    I just want to say, I&#39;m here, ons site, every time I can!!! <br />

    <div class="comment"><p class="date"><p><a href="http://domdelimar.com/" title="http://domdelimar.com/" rel="nofollow">Dom</a>  on <a id="Comment5" name="Comment5" title="Comment 5"></a>July 28, 2007:</p><p>Thanks Jill, it&#39;s always great to find out about people who are coming back regularly for more content. It makes me proud and eager to do even a better job writing about stuff I write about. <br />
    <br />
    So if you have any suggestions for the site or would like to read more about something (like from the world of Linux), feel free to drop me a line. I&#39;ll listen.<br />
    <br />
    I appreciate you visiting my site every time you can but I wonder whether you use the benefits of RSS technology to keep up with changes on this and other sites? <br />
    RSS technology allows you to keep up with changes on a lot of sites with ease. Well, here&#39;s something to write about - how I keep up with a lot of content from various sources...</p></div>
