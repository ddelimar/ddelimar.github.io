<span class="quote">&ldquo;The men who try to do something and fail are infinitely better than those who try nothing and succeed.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="quoteauthor">~ Lloyd Jones</span>

Words of reassurance to those of us who keep trying but at times don't feel like we're succeeding - we definitely are.

Which reminds me of the words of Thomas Edison when he was "advised" to stop trying to make a light bulb since he kept "failing":

<span class="quote">&ldquo;I didn’t fail ten thousand times. I successfully eliminated, ten thousand times, materials and combinations which wouldn’t work.&rdquo;</span>
