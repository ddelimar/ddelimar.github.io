<span class="quote">&ldquo;Aim at perfection in everything, though in most things it is unattainable. However, they who aim at it, and persevere, will come much nearer to it than those whose laziness and despondency make them give it up as unattainable.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="quoteauthor">~ Lord Chesterfield</span>

Nice. So being a perfectionist isn't all that bad after all. You just need to know that it's usually unattainable, so just don't get upset about that. ;)
