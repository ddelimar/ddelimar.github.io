<p class="quote">&ldquo;Pessimism never won any battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="quoteauthor">~ Dwight David Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States.</p>

I always like to tell other people there's no point in thinking negative and always try to think positive myself.

Never really could explain to them *<em>why</em>* there's any point in thinking positive (this sentence sounds a bit negative, don't you think so?).

I don't know. I guess it always was a no-brainer to me and I would like to but I tend to not understand why certain people think negative most of the time.

Is it fear? Are they so called "experienced optimists"? Even so, I think sometimes you have to make a willing effort for thinking positively about something. I do this sometimes too.

I'm not talking being unrealistic, but believing in yourself and instead of giving up, questioning your abilities and asking yourself what else you CAN do -- to get to the positive outcome.

I think Henry Ford best summed it up when he said:
