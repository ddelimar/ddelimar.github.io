<span class="quote">&ldquo;People form habits and habits form futures.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="quoteauthor">~ Mike Litman</span>

It's one of the most important things I was fortunate to learn early on from a fellow named Mike Litman.

He also said:
<span class="quote">&ldquo;Successful people make a habit of doing things they don't like to do.&rdquo;</span>

I must admit there are habits I continue to struggle with but I see it as a never ending process and not as a journey with an end.
