<p>I'm talking about people like me who are in a situation where they're having problems paying for their day to day bills.</p>

<p>And how do I get fast money in - at least just to cover for my absolute bare minimum monthly costs?</p>

<p>I take action. D'uh! </p>

<p>I knew that... but... what?</p>

<p>Look, even though I don't know you, I would bet you have some skills, some assets, something you could use to generate you a quick cash-flow in.</p>

<p>I myself, own a bunch of literature explaining certain business models, mostly internet based, a whole bunch of courses and workbooks on how to do something, some of which I have already mastered - meaning I DO HAVE knowledge. And everybody says knowledge is power. WRONG! In practiced knowledge lies power.</p>

<p>Why then don't I just use any of this to generate some quick cash and get me out of this situation?<br>
Well, maybe because I didn't have somebody to tell me how to do it so quickly that you wouldn't believe it's possible.</p>

<p>Only 7 days is needed to do a complete turnaround in your business or life.</p>

<p>Are you expecting me to give you a product that will teach you how to do it once and for all?</p>

<p>Good, because I know one.</p>

<p>Do you have a small fortune to cash out on such a great and needed product?</p>

<p>Sure, I didn't even think so, neither do I - I said I'm in a trouble.</p>

<p>Do you think I'll ask you for just pennies on the dollar to give you this practical information?</p>

<p>No, Mark Joyner will do it without even a single penny - he'll do it completely free, that is if you hurry.</p>

<p>Mark is so convinced in his just released <a href="http://www.simpleology.com/p/bta/uncover/mjletter" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker(&#39;/outgoing/simpleology_com_bta_mjletter&#39;);">7 Days Business Turnaround Simpleology</a> program that he wants you to try it, completely free of charge.</p>

<p>You better hurry if you're serious about this because he might not hold this offer for long - just ask yourself who gives away stuff for free?</p>

<p>In Mark's own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It's a risky move from a business perspective, but I have faith.</p>

<p>If there's one thing true about sales it's this: if you you<br>
have a revolutionary product - let your customer experience it<br>
first hand.</p>

<p>A good product should sell itself on its own merits.</p>

<p>So, none of you - no one reading this letter - will pay a single<br>
thin dime until your 7 day business turnaround is complete.”</p></blockquote>

<p>So if you still haven't picked up the free trial of his <a href="http://www.simpleology.com/p/bta/uncover/mjletter" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker(&#39;/outgoing/simpleology_com_bta_mjletter&#39;);">7 Day Business Turnaround Kit</a>, you should.</p>

<p>Especially if you need a quick cash injection to get the life flowing back in your business veins:</p>

<p>They are offering a 7 day trial of it - at no cost - right now, and rumor is that the trial (and the rare chance to work directly with Mark) are both going away at midnight tonight.</p>

<p>I hope you don't miss out!</p>
