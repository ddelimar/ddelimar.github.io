#{{ page.title }}

I just had to share this with everybody before anything else.

A very eye-opening article about the one thing that separates the men from the boys when it comes to entrepreneurship. <br />The one thing that all successful entrepreneurs possess and the others don't. And as you can tell from the title, it's not something you can touch.

Since I couldn't say it better than Mr. Ken McCarthy himself, you'll just have to take my word on it and go and read it.

If you want to accomplish anything more in your life, nothing is more important than this article.<em> (DISCLAIMER: For all I know, you may already be aware of this)</em>
